=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Store - how to write a Cache store plugin.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Store::Frobnicator;

    sub setup_frobnicator_cache_backend {
        my ( $app, $name, $config ) = @_;

        ....
        
        $app->register_cache_backend( $name => $cache_object );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order to write a cache store plugin, all you need is to implement a method
following the naming convention:

    setup_<<lower case store name>>_cache_backend {

    }

For example C<setup_fastmmap_cache_backend> for
L<Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Store::FastMmap>.

and call C<register_cache_backend> from within that.

The method will get the backend name and configuration as it's first and second
arguments.

All invokation of the setup methods will be automatic, based on the
configuration. However, the plugin must be loaded by the user.

Note that store plugins are only necessary if some configuration defaults that
are catalyst specific need to be provided.

For most cases simply using a cache class instead of a plugin is sufficient.
